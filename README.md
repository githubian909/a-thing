# a-thing
i dont care what you do with this 

anyway

javascript:$.getScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ZoltarML/Quasar@0.2/Quasar.js')

2 methods

1.type javascript: and then paste the rest of the script (wont paste the javascripr: for some reason)

2. (easier) select the line of code and drag it to ur bookmarks bar and then its a click away
